    <p>
      Public Works, at its core, is a space built for the people, by the people. We asked the community what they wanted to see in a nightclub and event space, and they answered. From our sprung, hardwood dance floor to our state-of-the-art Funktion-One sound system, we crowd-sourced our venue into existence.
    </p>
    <div
      className="about-description-image"

    </div>
    <p>
      Whether you are looking to dance, learn, or need an off site meeting place, public works has got you covered. From world-class DJ sets and live performances, to story slams, comedy shows, and art exhibits, there's something for everyone each week.

    <p>
      We also partner with local non-profits and offer an eclectic array of events so that we can directly engage with and give back to the communities that support us. We encourage and empower organizations that have a positive impact on our city and beyond.
